$ node app.js
```
- Add in-app screenshots.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- (Day 1) Learning to implement a user authentication system across two different frameworks was tricky, but having implemented it several times within Express. It was just the matter of translating the front-end to React and figuring out how data communitation would flow in React's "waterfall" method and between to the Express API server.
- (Day 2) Trying to get numerous API calls working between the online API and the local API has been tricky. Especially when also figuring how to manipulate that data while trying to have a coherant data structure that would make sense down the track. The most challenging things has been to process the data after the user imports the Wishlist alongside with trying to get the React/Express App working on Heroku.
- Talk about approach to the problem.
- Add screenshots/drawings of doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.

## :sob: Lessons learnt
### Day 1
Would certainly look at more detailed method in how user sessions can be made more secure in the future, as currently it is pretty much open for middleman attacks. It was certainly a challenge in learning how user authentication/login/logout works within the context of this React/Express app.
### Day 2
Definitely always wish I have more time to plan everything out, glad that I am at least writing notes down for future reference. A lot of bad code will need to get rewritten further down thee line, especially with more professional advice.

What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this

## Day 1 Diary
Day 1: getting the user signup/login system functional! (done)

Day 2 goals: getting the planned API implemented and functioning, bonus would be starting to have the site be more than barebones. Also will get the project uploaded to Heroku. With a lil bit of writing/thought processes on the project (hhhh)

Day 3 goals: MVP, hopefully! Able to join the app, get the wishlist imported and then sort it out to your needs. 
Plus definitely to figure out the bootstrap-i-fication of the site layout/etc...
And colours (not great at picking the colour pallet that isn't my sona... lol)

Day 4 goals: Will hopefully be just some more writing that's required for the project. Hopefully I can then work on some extension work, adding CSS animations/"fancy" functionality alongside maybe implementing Steam third-party login?
Having posts linked in would be awesome <3

Day 5 goals: Absolutely will still be working on the site the morning of, always never ending things to add and polish and bug fix. Heroku app will certainly be updated and working by today. (will had started testing on Day 2)

## Day 2 Diary
It started out fine, but there's certainly been a lot of pain. A fair bit of the goals for today were met, the API implementation has been successful (all the data gathered and then stored on the database, but does not show yet on the front-end to the user). Along with uploading the project to Heroku, but it seems to be having some JSON issues atm. Not fully sure why atm.

An update on the timeline then...

Day 3 goals: MVP, hopefully! Able to join the app, get the wishlist imported and then sort it out to your needs. Mostly would be to troubleshoot any Heroku upload problems.
With bare layout of the site having a touch of bootstrap-i-fication! With hopefully more colours too (not great at picking the colour pallet that isn't my sona... lol)

Day 4 goals: Will hopefully be just some more writing that's required for the project. Hopefully I can then work on some extension work, adding CSS animations/"fancy" functionality alongside maybe implementing Steam third-party login? Having posts linked and integrate it with the site as a whole would be awesome <3

Day 5 goals: Absolutely will still be working on the site the morning of, always never ending things to add and polish and bug fix. Heroku app will certainly be updated and working by today.
